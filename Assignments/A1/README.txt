^referenced code from here when trying to interpolate

From the slides on 1/23 used area formulas to find barycentric coordinates

When trying to compile and run on mac like it said when I ran make there was
a linker error for a reasaon I genuinely do not know why. Maybe it was becasue
I initially set up the files incorrectly but I'm not sure. But when running
on Xcode filling in the command line arguments starting at ./A1 <Arguments> 
it runs properly and everything works with CMD+B then CMD+R.
